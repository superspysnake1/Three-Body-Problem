# Phys 486 Three Body Problem Project
As the capstone project of my physics degree, I modeled the interaction of three astronomical bodies using the Euler-Cromer method of solving differential systems. As part of the project, I gave a presentation on my results to the class. The algorithm was programmed with Python in Jupyter Notebook. The writeup and presentation was generated using LaTeX.
